Faency is the [Traefik Labs](https://traefik.io) React component library.

### Installation

Run the following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install @traefiklabs/faency --save
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command instead:

```bash
yarn add @traefiklabs/faency
```

### Usage

- Wrap your app with the Faency provider

```js
import React from 'react'
import { Provider as FaencyProvider } from '@traefiklabs/faency'

const Root = () => (
  <FaencyProvider>
    <App />
  </FaencyProvider>
)
```

- In your app you can now import and use Faency components:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { Box, Button } from '@traefiklabs/faency'

const App = () => (
  <Box p={2}>
    <Button variant="primary">Click me</Button>
  </Box>
)
```

### Development

We use Storybook to create a simple, hot-reloading playground for development on Faency components.
You can edit/create a `*.story.tsx` file to preview a component.

#### Install dependencies using

```sh
  yarn
```

#### Initialize a Faency build

```sh
  yarn run init
```

#### Run documentation website + storybook

```sh
  yarn start
```

During this process Faency will be in watch mode which means that any change you made will be automatically applied to storybook and the documentation website.

### Build & Release

```sh
yarn build
```

#### Release

```sh
